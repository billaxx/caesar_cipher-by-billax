# Caesar Cipher Program

## Description
This is a Python program that performs text encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

## Author
**Mohamed Thaslim**

## Features
- Encrypts text using a specified shift value.
- Decrypts text using the same shift value.
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters (e.g., numbers, punctuation) without modification.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/)).
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed ([Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
- Basic familiarity with running Python scripts.

### Steps to Run the Program

1. **Clone the Repository in linux**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/billaxx/caesar_cipher-by-billax.git
   cd caesar-cipher
   run the python program by the following comman:-
   python caesar_cipher-by-billax.py
   
   ```

2. **Test the Program**
   - Follow the prompts:
     1. Choose to **encrypt** or **decrypt**.
     2. Enter your message.
     3. Enter the shift value (integer).
   - View the encrypted or decrypted result.

## Example

### Encryption Example
- Input:
  ```
  Do you want to 'encrypt' or 'decrypt'? encrypt
  Enter your message: Hello, World!
  Enter the shift value (integer): 3
  ```
- Output:
  ```
  The resulting text is: Khoor, Zruog!
  ```

### Decryption Example
- Input:
  ```
  Do you want to 'encrypt' or 'decrypt'? decrypt
  Enter your message: Khoor, Zruog!
  Enter the shift value (integer): 3
  ```
- Output:
  ```
  The resulting text is: Hello, World!
  ```
